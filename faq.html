    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><br><br>
 <div id = "faq">
        <h3><b>How are hostels allotted to freshmen? Does my hostel change every year?</b></h3>
        <div><p>Allotment of hostels is done while keeping in mind the required interaction among the

freshers. Room allotment is completely random. The students are accommodated in rooms of

four. There are two hostels for boys (freshers), Neptune and Jupiter, each having a capacity of

more than 120 students.

The hostel jupiter has an attached mess, whereas, the hostel neptune houses the Student

Activity Center (SAC) which comprises of a gym, dance room, music room and art room.

Girls are allotted the hostel venus which is a stone's throw away from the aforementioned

places. Girls are also accommodated in rooms of four and dine in the same mess as boys.</p></div>
        <h3><b>I have never lived in a hostel before. What should I expect from IIT hostels?</b></h3>
        <div><p>Hostel life is going to be very different from your home. At beginning you may feel the need

of larger rooms where lesser number of students live in, but at the end of your stay, you

would be crying to stay back. You are going to cherish your hostel memories for the rest of

your life.

Apart from academics and co-curricular activities, hostel life plays a major role in shaping

one's life. Away from parents and siblings, hostel life has much to offer. It inculcates in you,

a bit of sincerity, a shred of responsibility, and a great sense of adjustment. Living in a hostel

shapes your personality, and teaches you time management. You are going to cherish your

hostel memories for the rest of your life.</p></div>
        <h3><b>What facilities are available in the hostel?</b></h3>
        <div><p>The facilities available in the hostels of the institute are as follows
<br>
 Barber shop
<br>
 Laundry service (paid - nominal rates)
<br>
 A well-equipped gymnasium
<br>
 24-hour electricity backup
<br>
 Common room (TV room which is no less than a theatre during cricket and football

finals)
<br>
 RO filtered water
<br>
 Open terrace
<br>
 Gallery for better ventilation
<br>
 Bathroom with geyser (shared between two rooms)
<br>
 Individual cupboards/Godrej almirah for storage
<br>
 A table and a chair for each student
<br>
 Wi-Fi zone and lastly four high speed LAN ports (unlimited data download) are

<br>
In case of any problem, the caretaker is always approachable (Office timings). There will be

student hostel president for each hostel to listen to your problems and present them in the

hostel committee.</p></div>
        <h3><b>What about the mess food? Is the food

really tasty and healthy? Do we have a say

in the menu?</b></h3>
        <div><p>There is Mess-1 for Jupiter, Neptune and Venus hostels and Mess-2 for Mercury hostel. Mess

fees is included in the hostel fee itself and is to be paid every semester. Apart from this, night

canteen is available (until 3 in the morning) and also a regular canteen in daytime.

Quite honestly, saying that mess food is tasty would somewhat be an overstatement when you

would be coming here after having eaten home-cooked food for almost 18 years of your life.

However, it is hygienic, nutritious, filling and already paid for. A weekly menu is decided at

a periodic interval for the hostel. In case for a change, there are many places outside the

campus where you can eat. Every resident has a say in deciding the weekly mess menu. There

is a complaint register available in the mess in case you find the quality of food degraded.

Feedback is always welcomed. For immediate actions you can contact your hostel Mess

            Secretary.</p></div>
